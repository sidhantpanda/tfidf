#tf-idf scoring for Vector Space Models

This module returns results to a query using tf-idf scoring in the vector space model written in Python 2.7

Put all the documents in the "library" directory. Currently this module only takes files with .txt extension.

The sub-directory and query can be changed in implementation.py

Run the code using "python implementation.py" or "python2 implementation.py"
